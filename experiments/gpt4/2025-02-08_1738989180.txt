Term: Sport Mode
Definition: A type of flight mode available on certain drones offering higher speed and agility. This mode often disables certain safety features like obstacle avoidance.
Confidence: High

Term: Positioning Mode
Definition: Commonly referred to as "P-mode", it's a flight mode where the drone uses GPS (or GLONASS) and vision systems to stabilize its position when hovering and achieve precise navigation and better control.
Confidence: High

Term: Attitude Mode
Definition: Flight mode where the drone maintains its orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw), but does not leverage GPS for position hold. This allows for completely manual flight, often used by skilled pilots for specific maneuvers.
Confidence: High

Term: Remote Controller
Definition: Handheld device used by the operator to maneuver drone, control camera gimbal, enable various features, and monitor drone status via built-in communication link.
Confidence: High

Term: Interference
Definition: Any disturbance that may degrade, interrupt, or limit the effective performance of the drone, often in the context of signal transmission between the drone and the controller.
Confidence: High

Term: Gyroscope
Definition: A device that measures angular velocity (rotation). It is one of the critical parts of Inertial Measurement Unit used in drone's flight controller to maintain and control drone's orientation.
Confidence: High

Term: LOS (Line Of Sight)
Definition: Direct unaided (excluding devices such as binoculars) visual contact with the drone from the operator's perspective. LOS is fundamental for safe operation of manually controlled drones.
Confidence: High

Term: Payload
Definition: The additional weight a drone can carry besides its own weight, including cameras, sensors, or other equipment, depending on its mission requirements.
Confidence: High

Term: RTH (Return to Home)
Definition: An automated safety feature of drones which triggers the drone to return to its pre-set home point when the battery is low, the connection is lost, or manually triggered by the operator.
Confidence: High

Term: VLOS (Visual Line Of Sight)
Definition: Term used in regulations to denote the maximum distance a drone can be flown away from its operator while still remaining visible.
Confidence: High

Term: RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)
Definition: A high-precision GPS positioning technique providing centimeter-level accuracy, often used in drones for mapping and surveying applications.
Confidence: High

Term: Anti-Collision
Definition: A system or feature in drones which uses sensors to detect potential obstacles and take steps to avoid a collision.
Confidence: High

Term: Drone
Definition: A term commonly used to refer to an unmanned aircraft, operated remotely or autonomously.
Confidence: High

Term: Follow Me Mode
Definition: An automatic control mode where the drone follows and keeps the camera targeted on the controller or another designated object.
Confidence: High

Term: Gimbal
Definition: A pivoted support that allows the rotation of an object (often a camera) about a single axis. On drones, gimbals are used to stabilize cameras to capture smooth video footage.
Confidence: High

Term: GPS
Definition: Global Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system used for positioning, navigation, and timing services in drones.
Confidence: High

Term: Hover
Definition: When a drone maintains a stable altitude and position using built-in stabilization technology.
Confidence: High

Term: Home Point
Definition: The location to which the drone will return if Return-To-Home (RTH) mode is engaged.
Confidence: High

Term: IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
Definition: A device that measures and reports specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. IMUs are used in drone systems to provide flight controller with necessary data about orientation and speed.
Confidence: High

Term: Intelligent Flight Modes
Definition: Pre-programmed modes in some drones that use advanced flight control algorithms and sensors to perform complex maneuvers or follow preset flight paths automatically.
Confidence: High

Term: No-Fly Zone
Definition: Areas defined by regulatory authorities where drone flights are restricted for safety and security reasons.
Confidence: High

Term: Obstacle Avoidance System
Definition: A system equipped on certain drones using sensors to detect and avoid obstacles in its path.
Confidence: High

Term: Propeller Guard
Definition: A protective accessory fitted around the propellers of a drone to reduce the risk of damage or injury from the spinning propellers.
Confidence: High

Term: Remote ID
Definition: Digital identification that allows law enforcement, public and aviation safety officials to remotely identify and track drones in flight.
Confidence: High

Term: Waypoint
Definition: A reference point in physical space used for purposes of navigation, often part of a pre-defined flight path in automated drone flights.
Confidence: High

Term: Propellers
Definition: Rotating blades used by drones to generate lift. The thrust produced by spinning propellers allows the drone to ascend, descend, and hover.
Confidence: High

Term: Tripod mode
Definition: A slow, precise flight mode designed for smooth and stable camera movements.
Confidence: High

Term: Pitch
Definition: The tilting motion of a drone when it moves up or down, controlled by the adjustment of speed between the front and rear rotors.
Confidence: High

Term: Throttle
Definition: The control on the remote controller that adjusts the overall speed of the drone’s propellers. Increasing the throttle causes the drone to ascend, while decreasing it causes the drone to descend.
Confidence: High

Term: Yaw
Definition: The rotation of a drone around its vertical axis, causing the drone to turn left or right. This is usually achieved by adjusting the balance of power between left and right propellers.
Confidence: High

Term: Roll
Definition: A drone's sideways movement, either to the left or right. This is achieved by adjusting the balance of power between the left and right sides of the drone.
Confidence: High
