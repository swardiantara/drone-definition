---

**Term:** LOS (Line Of Sight)  
**Definition:** The direct, unobstructed visual path between the drone and the operator. Maintaining LOS is a regulatory requirement in many regions to ensure safe operation.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Payload  
**Definition:** Any additional equipment or cargo carried by the drone, such as cameras, sensors, or delivery packages. Payload capacity is a critical factor in drone design and operation.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** RTH (Return to Home)  
**Definition:** A safety feature that automatically directs the drone to return to its takeoff point (home point) when triggered by low battery, signal loss, or manual command.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** VLOS (Visual Line of Sight)  
**Definition:** The requirement for the operator to maintain unaided visual contact with the drone during flight, ensuring safe operation and compliance with aviation regulations.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)  
**Definition:** A GPS enhancement technology that provides centimeter-level positioning accuracy by using a fixed base station to correct satellite signals in real time. Commonly used in surveying and precision agriculture.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Anti-Collision  
**Definition:** Systems or features designed to prevent the drone from colliding with obstacles, including sensors, cameras, and software algorithms for obstacle detection and avoidance.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Drone  
**Definition:** An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can be remotely controlled or operate autonomously. Drones are used for various applications, including photography, surveillance, delivery, and mapping.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Follow Me Mode  
**Definition:** An intelligent flight mode where the drone autonomously follows a moving subject, typically using GPS or visual tracking. Commonly used in action sports and filmmaking.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Gimbal  
**Definition:** A stabilizing mount for cameras or sensors that keeps them level and steady during flight, even when the drone moves or tilts. Gimbals are essential for capturing smooth, high-quality footage.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** GPS (Global Positioning System)  
**Definition:** A satellite-based navigation system that provides location and time information. Drones use GPS for navigation, position holding, and waypoint missions.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Hover  
**Definition:** The ability of a drone to maintain a stable position in the air without moving horizontally or vertically. Hovering is achieved through precise control of the propellers and stabilization systems.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Home Point  
**Definition:** The location where the drone takes off, which is recorded by the GPS. The drone can return to this point automatically using the RTH feature.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)  
**Definition:** A device that combines accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure a drone's velocity, orientation, and gravitational forces. The IMU is critical for flight stabilization and navigation.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Intelligent Flight Modes  
**Definition:** Pre-programmed flight modes that automate complex tasks, such as Follow Me, Waypoint Navigation, and Orbit. These modes enhance the drone's capabilities for specific applications.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** No-Fly Zone  
**Definition:** Restricted airspace where drone operations are prohibited or limited, often due to safety, security, or privacy concerns. Examples include airports, military bases, and national parks.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Obstacle Avoidance System  
**Definition:** A system that uses sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR, or ultrasonic) to detect and avoid obstacles in the drone's flight path, enhancing safety and autonomy.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Propeller Guard  
**Definition:** A protective frame or ring installed around the drone's propellers to prevent damage to the propellers or surrounding objects during collisions.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Remote ID  
**Definition:** A system that broadcasts a drone's identification, location, and other data to authorities and other airspace users. Remote ID is a regulatory requirement in many regions to enhance safety and accountability.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Waypoint  
**Definition:** A predefined GPS coordinate that the drone follows during an automated mission. Waypoints are used for mapping, surveying, and other precision tasks.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Propellers  
**Definition:** Rotating blades that generate lift and thrust by spinning at high speeds. Propellers are a critical component of a drone's propulsion system.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Tripod Mode  
**Definition:** A flight mode that reduces the drone's speed and sensitivity, making it easier to control for precise movements, such as filming or photography.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Pitch  
**Definition:** The rotation of the drone around its lateral axis, causing it to tilt forward or backward. Pitch controls forward and backward movement.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Throttle  
**Definition:** The control input that adjusts the power to the drone's motors, increasing or decreasing altitude.  
**Confidence:** High  

---

**Term:** Yaw  
**Definition:** The rotation of the drone around its vertical axis, causing it to turn left or right. Yaw controls the drone's heading.
