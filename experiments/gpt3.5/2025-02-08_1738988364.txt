Definition: A flight mode where the drone autonomously tracks and follows a moving subject, usually based on GPS or signal from the remote controller. Follow Me Mode is commonly used for capturing dynamic footage or monitoring activities.
Confidence: High

Gimbal:
Definition: A mechanical device that stabilizes and controls the orientation of the camera mounted on the drone. A gimbal improves the quality of aerial photography and video by reducing vibrations and maintaining a steady shot.
Confidence: High

GPS:
Definition: Global Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system used by drones to determine their precise location, speed, and altitude. GPS is essential for autonomous flight, waypoint navigation, and accurate positioning.
Confidence: High

Hover:
Definition: A flight maneuver where the drone maintains a stable position in the air without drifting or changing altitude. Hovering is essential for photography, video recording, and precise control during flight.
Confidence: High

Home Point:
Definition: The initial takeoff location or designated landing spot set as a reference point for the drone's return to home feature. The home point is crucial for the drone to navigate back safely in case of emergencies.
Confidence: High

IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):
Definition: A sensor system that combines accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure and track the drone's orientation, velocity, and acceleration. The IMU provides critical data for flight control and stabilization.
Confidence: High

Intelligent Flight Modes:
Definition: Pre-programmed flight modes or features available on advanced drones to automate specific maneuvers, such as automatic takeoff and landing, orbiting, and follow modes. Intelligent flight modes enhance user experience and enable creative aerial shots.
Confidence: High

No-Fly Zone:
Definition: Restricted airspace areas where drone flight is prohibited or regulated due to safety, privacy, or security concerns. No-fly zones are typically designated around airports, military installations, and sensitive locations.
Confidence: High

Obstacle Avoidance System:
Definition: Sensors and algorithms that detect and avoid obstacles in the drone's flight path to prevent collisions. The obstacle avoidance system enhances safety and maneuverability in complex environments.
Confidence: High

Propeller Guard:
Definition: Protective barriers or shields installed around the drone's propellers to reduce the risk of injury or damage in case of collisions. Propeller guards improve safety during flight, especially in indoor or close proximity operations.
Confidence: High

Remote ID:
Definition: A regulatory requirement for drones to broadcast identification information, such as the drone's registration number and operator details, for remote tracking and identification by authorities. Remote ID enhances accountability and airspace safety.
Confidence: High

Waypoint:
Definition: Predefined GPS coordinates or locations set for the drone to navigate autonomously along a programmed flight path. Waypoint navigation allows the drone to fly to specific points, follow routes, and perform automated missions.
Confidence: High

Propellers:
Definition: Rotating blades attached to the motors that generate lift and thrust to propel the drone through the air. Propellers come in various sizes, shapes, and materials to optimize performance and efficiency.
Confidence: High

Tripod mode:
Definition: A flight mode that slows down the drone's movement and sensitivity for precise and stable hovering. Tripod mode is ideal for capturing smooth footage or conducting detailed inspections.
Confidence: High

Pitch:
Definition: The rotation of the drone around its lateral axis, causing the nose to move up or down. Pitch controls the drone's forward or backward movement during flight.
Confidence: High
