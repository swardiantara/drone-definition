Term: Sport Mode
Definition: A flight mode that allows the drone to fly at its maximum speed and agility by reducing or disabling the assistance from GPS and other sensors, offering more direct control to the pilot.
Confidence: Medium

Term: Positioning Mode
Definition: A flight mode that utilizes GPS and other sensors to maintain a stable position, making it easier for the pilot to hover and fly steadily.
Confidence: High

Term: Attitude Mode
Definition: A flight mode that relies on the drone's internal sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, to maintain a stable attitude, without using GPS. This mode requires more manual control and is often used by experienced pilots.
Confidence: Medium

Term: Remote Controller
Definition: A device used by the pilot to control the drone's movements and functions remotely.
Confidence: High

Term: Interference
Definition: Disruption of the communication signal between the drone and the remote controller, or other electronic systems, which can be caused by electromagnetic waves, physical obstacles, or other devices operating on similar frequencies.
Confidence: High

Term: Gyroscope
Definition: A sensor that measures the angular velocity or rate of rotation of the drone. This data is used by the flight controller to maintain stability and orientation.
Confidence: High

Term: LOS (Line Of Sight)
Definition: The ability to see your drone from an operating position with your naked eye7.
Confidence: High

Term: Payload
Definition: The maximum weight a drone can carry, including cameras, sensors, and other equipment, without compromising flight performance or safety7.
Confidence: High

Term: RTH (Return to Home)
Definition: A GPS feature that when enabled, it returns the aircraft to the "home" position where it took off1.
Confidence: High

Term: VLOS (Visual Line of Sight)
Definition: Operation of a UAV within the pilot’s direct, unaided line of sight. Regulatory agencies often require VLOS for certain operations unless waivers or special permissions are granted7.
Confidence: High

Term: RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)
Definition: A high-precision GPS correction technology that enhances the accuracy of positioning data by using a base station to correct for errors in real-time, enabling centimeter-level accuracy1.
Confidence: High

Term: Anti-Collision
Definition: Systems or technologies designed to prevent drones from colliding with obstacles or other aircraft, often involving sensors and automated avoidance maneuvers3.
Confidence: High

Term: Drone
Definition: An aircraft that flies without a human pilot onboard, relying on remote control or autonomous systems for navigation and operation7. Also referred to as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)7.
Confidence: High

Term: Follow Me Mode
Definition: An intelligent flight mode where the drone automatically follows a subject (e.g., the pilot) using GPS and visual tracking1.
Confidence: Medium

Term: Gimbal
Definition: A mechanical device that stabilizes a camera or sensor, allowing it to remain steady even when the drone is moving or experiencing vibrations1.
Confidence: High

Term: GPS
Definition: Global Positioning System; a satellite-based navigation system used to determine the precise location of the drone2.
Confidence: High

Term: Hover
Definition: To maintain a stationary position in the air3.
Confidence: High

Term: Home Point
Definition: The GPS location where the drone takes off, which is recorded by the drone and used as the return point when the Return to Home (RTH) function is activated1.
Confidence: High

Term: IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
Definition: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers1.
Confidence: High

Term: Intelligent Flight Modes
Definition: Automated flight patterns and assistance features enabled through onboard software and sensors, such as Follow Me, Waypoint Navigation, and Orbit Mode1.
Confidence: High

Term: No-Fly Zone
Definition: An area where drone flights are restricted or prohibited. These zones are typically established around airports, government buildings, and sensitive infrastructure to ensure safety and security3.
Confidence: High

Term: Obstacle Avoidance System
Definition: The system used by drones to detect and navigate around objects in their flight path. This feature is essential for safe operation, especially in complex environments or when the drone is flying autonomously3.
Confidence: High

Term: Propeller Guard
Definition: Protective frames attached around the propellers to prevent damage during collisions and to protect people and objects from the spinning blades3.
Confidence: High

Term: Remote ID
Definition: A technology that allows drones to be remotely identified, typically through a broadcast signal, to comply with aviation regulations and enhance airspace safety1.
Confidence: High

Term: Waypoint
Definition: A set of GPS coordinates that define a specific location the drone will navigate to, often used to create automated flight paths1.
Confidence: High

Term: Propellers
Definition: Rotating blades that generate thrust, lifting the drone into the air and enabling it to move3.
Confidence: High

Term: Tripod Mode
Definition: A flight mode that reduces the drone's speed and responsiveness, making it easier to capture stable and smooth footage, similar to using a tripod for photography1.
Confidence: Medium

Term: Pitch
Definition: The up or down rotation of the drone around its lateral axis, controlled by moving the control stick forward or backward1.
Confidence: High

Term: Throttle
Definition: The control that regulates the motor speed, determining the drone's altitude or rate of ascent/descent1.
Confidence: High

Term: Yaw
Definition: The rotation of the drone around its vertical axis, causing it to point left or right, controlled by the rudder1.
Confidence: High

Term: Roll
Definition: The rotation of the drone around its longitudinal axis, causing it to bank left or right, controlled by the ailerons1.
Confidence: High
