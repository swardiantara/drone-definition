Term: Sport Mode
Definition: From a drone expert's perspective, Sport Mode (also known as S-Mode) is a specialized flight mode that optimizes a drone's performance for high-speed, agile flight by:

Key Characteristics:
1. Enhanced Speed: Maximizes the drone's velocity capabilities, typically increasing top speed by 30-40% compared to normal mode
2. Increased Responsiveness: Provides more aggressive control inputs and faster reaction times
3. Disabled Obstacle Avoidance: Usually deactivates obstacle detection systems to prevent interference during high-speed maneuvers
4. Modified Flight Parameters:
- Higher maximum tilt angles
- Increased acceleration/deceleration rates
- More sensitive control inputs
- Reduced GPS dependence

Technical Considerations:
- Higher power consumption
- Reduced flight time due to increased motor strain
- Greater skill requirement for safe operation
- Increased risk of crashes due to reduced safety features
- Typically used for sport flying, racing, or dynamic cinematography

Sport Mode requires advanced piloting skills and should be used with caution, as the reduced safety features and increased performance capabilities can lead to accidents if not properly managed.
