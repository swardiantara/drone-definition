Sport Mode
Definition: A flight mode that maximizes drone performance, allowing higher speed and more aggressive maneuverability. Typically reduces flight stabilization and safety constraints for experienced pilots.
Confidence: High

Positioning Mode
Definition: A flight mode that uses GPS and other positioning systems to maintain the drone's location and stability. Provides more precise hovering and easier control compared to manual flight modes.
Confidence: High

Attitude Mode
Definition: A flight mode where the drone maintains its current orientation and altitude but allows manual control of pitch, roll, and yaw. Provides more pilot control with reduced automatic stabilization.
Confidence: High

Remote Controller
Definition: The handheld device used by a drone pilot to control the drone's flight, camera, and other functions through radio communication signals.
Confidence: High

Interference
Definition: Disruption of drone communication or navigation signals caused by electromagnetic noise, physical obstacles, or conflicting radio frequencies that can impact drone performance and control.
Confidence: High

Gyroscope
Definition: A sensor that measures and maintains the drone's orientation, rotation, and angular velocity. Critical for maintaining stability and enabling precise flight control.
Confidence: High

LOS (Line Of Sight)
Definition: The direct, unobstructed visual path between the drone pilot and the drone during flight. Regulatory guidelines often require maintaining LOS during drone operations.
Confidence: High

Payload
Definition: Any equipment or cargo carried by the drone, such as cameras, sensors, delivery packages, or scientific instruments.
Confidence: High

RTH (Return to Home)
Definition: An automated flight function where the drone autonomously returns to a pre-set home point, typically triggered by low battery, signal loss, or pilot command.
Confidence: High

VLOS (Visual Line of Sight)
Definition: A flight operation where the drone pilot maintains direct, unaided visual contact with the drone throughout the entire flight.
Confidence: High

RTK (Real-Time Kinematic)
Definition: A high-precision GPS positioning technique that provides centimeter-level accuracy by using real-time corrections from ground-based reference stations.
Confidence: High

Anti-Collision
Definition: Systems and technologies designed to detect and avoid obstacles during flight, using sensors like ultrasonic, infrared, or vision-based detection to prevent potential crashes.
Confidence: High

Drone
Definition: An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) controlled remotely or autonomously, capable of flight without an onboard human pilot.
Confidence: High

Follow Me Mode
Definition: An intelligent flight mode where the drone automatically tracks and follows a designated subject, maintaining a consistent distance and camera orientation.
Confidence: High

Gimbal
Definition: A pivoted support that allows camera or sensor rotation on multiple axes, enabling stable and smooth video/image capture during drone flight.
Confidence: High

GPS
Definition: Global Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system providing location and time information for drone positioning and navigation.
Confidence: High

Hover
Definition: A stable, stationary flight state where the drone maintains a fixed position in the air without forward, backward, or lateral movement.
Confidence: High

Home Point
Definition: A predetermined geographic location used as a reference for RTH (Return to Home) functions, typically the drone's takeoff location.
Confidence: High

IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
Definition: An electronic device that measures and reports drone acceleration, orientation, and angular velocity using accelerometers and gyroscopes.
Confidence: High

Intelligent Flight Modes
Definition: Advanced, pre-programmed flight modes that enable automated or semi-automated drone operations like waypoint navigation, panorama shooting, or subject tracking.
Confidence: High

No-Fly Zone
Definition: Restricted airspace areas where drone flight is prohibited or requires special authorization, typically near airports, government facilities, or sensitive locations.
Confidence: High

Obstacle Avoidance System
Definition: Integrated drone technology using sensors and algorithms to detect and automatically avoid obstacles during flight, enhancing safety and autonomy.
Confidence: High

Propeller Guard
Definition: A protective frame or shield surrounding drone propellers to prevent injury and minimize damage during close-proximity operations.
Confidence: High

Remote ID
Definition: A system requiring drones to broadcast identification and location information, enabling tracking and identification for regulatory compliance.
Confidence: High

Waypoint
Definition: A specific geographic coordinate used to define a drone's planned flight path, allowing precise, pre-programmed navigation.
Confidence: High

Propellers
Definition: Rotating blades that generate thrust and lift, enabling drone flight by creating differential air pressure.
Confidence: High

Tripod Mode
Definition: A flight mode that significantly reduces drone speed and sensitivity for ultra-stable, precise positioning, often used for complex cinematography or delicate maneuvers.
Confidence: High

Pitch
Definition: The vertical tilting movement of the drone around its lateral axis, controlling forward and backward motion.
Confidence: High

Throttle
Definition: The control input that adjusts the drone's vertical speed and altitude by modifying motor power.
Confidence: High

Yaw
Definition: The horizontal rotation of the drone around its vertical axis, allowing it to change heading without changing position.
Confidence: High

Roll
Definition: The lateral tilting movement of the drone around its longitudinal axis, controlling side-to-side motion.
Confidence: High
