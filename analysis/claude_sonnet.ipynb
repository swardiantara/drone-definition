Typically used for dynamic filming or racing.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nPositioning Mode: Flight mode using GPS and vision sensors for precise hovering and controlled flight. Most common mode for photography and general flying.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nAttitude Mode: Basic flight mode that maintains altitude but doesn't use GPS for position holding. Relies on barometer and IMU only.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nTripod Mode: Ultra-precise flight mode with reduced speed and control sensitivity for steady filming and indoor navigation.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nCONTROLS:\\nPitch: The rotation of the drone forward or backward around its lateral axis.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nRoll: The rotation of the drone left or right around its longitudinal axis.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nYaw: The rotation of the drone around its vertical axis (turning left or right).\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nThrottle: Control input that determines the drone's vertical movement (up/down) by adjusting motor speed.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nCOMPONENTS:\\nRemote Controller: The handheld device used to control the drone, typically featuring control sticks, buttons, and sometimes a screen for telemetry data.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nGyroscope: Sensor that measures rotational movement around three axes, crucial for maintaining flight stability.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nPayload: Any additional equipment carried by the drone (cameras, sensors, delivery packages, etc.).\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nGimbal: A motorized stabilization system that holds cameras or sensors, compensating for drone movement to maintain steady positioning.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nPropellers: The rotating blades that generate lift and thrust for the drone's flight.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nPropeller Guard: Protective frames around propellers to prevent damage from collisions and protect people from spinning blades.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nSYSTEMS & FEATURES:\\nRTH (Return to Home): Automated function that returns the drone to its recorded takeoff point or set home location.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nRTK (Real-Time Kinematic): High-precision GPS positioning system that provides centimeter-level accuracy using base station corrections.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nAnti-Collision: Systems and sensors that detect and avoid obstacles during flight.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nFollow Me Mode: Intelligent flight mode where the drone automatically follows a moving subject while maintaining camera focus.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nGPS (Global Positioning System): Satellite-based navigation system used for precise positioning and flight planning.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nIMU (Inertial Measurement Unit): Combined sensor system including accelerometer and gyroscope for measuring movement and orientation.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nIntelligent Flight Modes: Pre-programmed flight patterns and automated functions for specific filming or survey tasks.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nObstacle Avoidance System: Sensors and software that detect and avoid obstacles during flight.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nRemote ID: System that broadcasts drone identification and location information to other aircraft and authorities.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nCONCEPTS & TERMS:\\nDrone: An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) capable of sustained flight and remote operation.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nLOS (Line Of Sight): Direct visual path between two points, typically between controller and drone.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nVLOS (Visual Line Of Sight): Operating condition where the pilot maintains direct visual contact with the drone.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nHover: Maintained stationary flight position in the air.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nHome Point: Recorded location (usually takeoff point) used as reference for RTH function.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nNo-Fly Zone: Restricted airspace where drone operations are prohibited by law or regulation.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nWaypoint: Predetermined geographic coordinates used for automated flight planning.\\nConfidence: High\\n\\nInterference: Electronic signals that disrupt communication between drone and controller.\\nConfidence: High\""
